# Mines
https://JoaoSangue.github.io/mines

A minesweeper game made in JavaScript implemented with the [p5.js](https://p5js.org) library.

## Game
The minesweeper game is composed of a grid of squares in which some bombs may be hidden. The game's objective is to open all squares without bombs as fast as possible.
A left-click or a middle-click of the mouse in a square will open it and show it's content. If the square contains a bomb, it will explode and the game will be over. If it doesn't a number will be shown representing the amount of bombs placed in the nearby squares(the adjacent ones). If there's no bomb nearby the adjacent squares will also open. Flags can be placed and removed from squares you think there's a bomb with a right-click of the mouse. A square with a flag becomes disable, so you won't be able to open them, having a bomb or not.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute to the project. Add issues reporting bugs you find, new features are already planned, but if you want ask for one. This project was made as an attempt to make something graphical and learn to use JavaScript (which I've never even touched before), so if you think there's a  better way to write a part of the code propose the change and explain why in the commit text.
